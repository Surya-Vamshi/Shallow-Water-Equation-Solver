# Shallow-Water-Equation-Solver
This is the code from my semiar containing basic solver for shallow water equations and two different coupling earthquake and tsunami simulations code.

Please install required libraries: Numpy, Numba and Matplotlib 

To just use the solver for shallow water equations, run the main.py in basic code folder by editing the parameters as required.

For tsumani simulations, go to the required method folder and run the respective main files.
- Instantaneous source method
- Time-dependent source method
